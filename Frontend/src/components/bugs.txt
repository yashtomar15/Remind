Signup is not working properly because after Signup we need to login once for getting the token , 
In signup we doesn't get token in response of posting data --
>and our reminder app is storing reminders in Signin persons database for this we need to have token of login user,
-->which we only get form login not Signup.
but in right manner Signup is also need to give token in return of posting data.

Solution: correct Signup method from backend and deploy again.
